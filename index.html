    <ol>
        <li>Helping out my friends suceed in life</li>
        <li>Hike in the mountains</li>
        <li>Playing Videgogames such as Destiny or fighting games</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
	One of my favorite websites is <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>, because this platform allows people to upload anything and everything in a video format. This has been very helpful since tutorials and artists get to really flourish and help spread knowledge on 'how-to' videos and more!
