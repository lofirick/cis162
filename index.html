	One of my favorite websites is <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>, because this platform allows people to upload anything and everything in a video format. This has been very helpful since tutorials and artists get to really flourish and help spread knowledge on 'how-to' videos and more!
